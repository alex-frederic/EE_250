# lab_01 just contains image files for Ubuntu and Raspbian for EE 250.
# Such large files cause problems when pushing to GitHub, and they can be found
# elsewhere on the class cloud.
# This are kept locally for convenience, but consider zipping if you want to
# save them to GitHub.

# Componoent_Files in lab_07 contains some decently data-heavy component files.
# These are free downloads off of SnapEda, so no reason to store them in the
# GitHub. The only reason they are on the computer is for KiCad modeling.
