Answer to Question 1a:

We are using certificate-based authentication via SSL/TLS. This type of
authentication requires a public key and a private key.


Answer to Question 1b:

The public key is used to send the session key from the client to the server.
Then, once both nodes agree on the session key, the session key is used to
encrypt all further data transported during the session.

The client can encrypt the message with its private key before sending it to
the server. The server can then decrypt the message using the client's public
key. If it decrypts successfully, then that message must have been encrypted
by that client's specific private key, which theoretically only they possess.
Therefore, in that case, the message must have been written and encrypted by
the client, verifying the message's authorship. Alternatively, only a small
portion of the message, liked a signature generated by a hash, could be
encrypted to save on asymmetric decryption time.


Answer to Question 2:

The private key is "server-key.pem", and the public key is contained in the
certificate "server-cert.pem".


Answer to Question 3:

A certificate authority is an organization that issues and keeps track of
digital certificates proving that the owner is the rightful owner of a certain
public key. This prevents man-in-the-middle attacks.
